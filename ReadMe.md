The Rexx Parser
===============

```
/********************************* WARNING ************************************
 * This version of the Rexx Parser is a work-in-progress. In particular, some *
 * parts of the APIs (like the Tree API) are largely undocumented; they will  *
 * be defined at a later stage of the package development.                    *
 ******************************************************************************/
```

The Rexx Parser is hosted on:

- <https://rexx.epbcn.com/rexx-parser/> (daily builds *and* releases,
  full documentation).
- <https://github.com/JosepMariaBlasco/rexx-parser/> (releases only,
  documentation is partial due to the limitations of GitHub highlighting).

The documentation copy at <https://rexx.epbcn.com/rexx-parser/> uses
the Rexx Highlighter to display Rexx programs, and therefore has better
highlihting. On the other hand, the copy at
<https://github.com/JosepMariaBlasco/rexx-parser/>
has version control, bug reporting, and all the features offered by GitHub.

**Beware**: some of the program listings that appear in this documentation
will not display at all in the GitHub version, as GitHub does not implement
the `source` attribute for Rexx fenced code blocks.
