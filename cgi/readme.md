CGI version of this site
========================

-----------

This site is distributed as a zipfile which contains
all the programs to run [the Rexx Parser](/rexx-parser/)
and its child project programs, such as
[the Rexx Highlighter](/rexx-parser/doc/highlighter/),
as well as the related documentation: the file you
are reading now, for example, is part of this documentation.

The documentation is distributed as a set of Markdown
files. On the reference distribution site,
<https://rexx.epbcn.com/rexx-parser/>, these Markdown
files are translated on-the-fly into HTML by
a Rexx Apache CGI program, `CGI.markdown.rex`,
reproduced below.

The program is provided as a sample only, and it should be
customized to fit your needs if you want to use it
in your own site. In particular, parts of the
Bootstrap 3 page are generated by an accompanying
program, [rexx.epbcn.com.optional.cls](rexx.epbcn.com.optional.cls),
which tries to encapsulate most of the localisms
present in the <http://rexx.epbcn.com/> site.
