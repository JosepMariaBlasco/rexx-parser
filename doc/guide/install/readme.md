Installation
============

-----------------------------------------------

Prerequisites
-------------

- A working ooRexx 5.0 installation (5.1 is recommended).

Installation
------------

+ Go to [the downloads section](/rexx-parser/#download) of the
  [main Parser page](/rexx-parser/),
  download the most current version of [the Rexx Parser](/rexx-parser/), and
  unzip it in a directory of your choice.
+ You can also install the Rexx Parser as part of the
  **net-oo-rexx** software bundle. The net-oo-rexx package
  can be downloaded at
  <https://wi.wu.ac.at/rgf/rexx/tmp/net-oo-rexx-packages/>.

You can also opt for [a CGI installation](../../highlighter/cgi/), which is quite more involved.

First steps: checking that your installation works
--------------------------------------------------

Proceed to the [first steps](/rexx-parser/doc/guide/first-steps/) page
to check that your installation works properly.
