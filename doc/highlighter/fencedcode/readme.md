Rexx Fenced code blocks
=======================

-----------------------------------------

The *FencedCode* routine processes
Markdown-style Rexx fenced code blocks
and highlights its contents according
to a set of provided options.

*FencedCode* is language-agnostic, in the
sense that it is only interested in processing
the Rexx fenced code blocks. This means that
you can use it to highlight Markdown files,
but, additionally, if you are willing to use
the Markdown fenced code block format in other
contexts, you can also highlight, for example,
code blocks present in html files.

Argument
--------

An array of strings containing the code (usually, Markdown or HTML)
containing the Rexx fenced code blocks we want to highlight.

Returns
-------

A new array where all the Rexx fenced code blocks are substituted
by their highlighted versions.

+ Both <code>```</code> and <code>~~~</code> markers are accepted, but they should start on column 1.
+ You can use three or more backticks or twiddles, but the closing marker
  has to have exactly the same number of backticks or twiddles than the
  opening one.
+ You cannot start with <code>```</code> and end with <code>~~~</code>, or viceversa.
+ The word `rexx` has to follow the backtick or twiddle marker, with or without
  intervening blanks or tabs. Code blocks that are not marked with `rexx`
  will not be processed by this routine.
+ If you want to specify additional attributes, you may do so by enclosing
  them between braces after the `rexx` marker. Blanks and/or tabs after
  `rexx` and before the left brace are optional.

~~~rexx {attributes}

Optional attributes
-------------------

Attributes are blank-separated booleans, which are usually preceded
by a dot, or `name=value` pairs. When a value contains blanks,
it has to be enclosed in single or double quotes.

~~~~
~~~rexx {.boolean1 name1=value1 .boolean2 name2="long value" ...}
~~~~

Possible attributes are:

#### `assignment= "group" | "full" | "detail"`

Determines how assignment operator sequences will be highlighted.
When "group" is specified, a single, generic, HTML class will be
assigned to every assignment sequence. When "detail" is specified,
every assigment sequence will get its own, different, HTML class
(this means, for example, that all simple assignments, "=", will
be assigned the same HTML class, all "+=" assignments will be
assigned a different class, and so on). When "full" is specified,
both a generic and a specific class will be assigned, in This
order.

#### `classprefix= "rx-"`

Define the class prefix used for HTML classes. Default is "rx-".

#### `constant= "group" | "full" | "detail"`

Determines how taken constants (strings or symbols taken as a
constant) will be highlighted.

#### <code>extraletters=<em>string</em></code> {#extraletters}

Allows all characters in *string* to be part of identifiers.
The string has to be specified between quotes. For example,
if you specify `extraletters="@#$"` the following
will be valid identifiers:

~~~rexx {extraletters="@#$"}
  -- The following is a standard Rexx and ooRexx variable
  var  = 1
  -- The next variables are considered to have valid names
  -- only because extraletters="@#$" was specified
  var@ = 2
  var# = 3
  var$ = 4
~~~

#### `.numberLines` (or `.number-lines`) {#numberlines}

Include line numbers in the code listing:

~~~rexx {.numberLines}
  If a = b Then Say "Yes"
  Else Say "No"
~~~

See also [numberWidth](#numberwidth) and [startFrom](#startfrom).

#### <code>numberWidth=<em>width</em></code> {#numberwidth}

Ensures that the line numbers will occupy at least <em>width</em>
characters in the listing. The highlighter may use more that
<em>width</em> characters if this is necessary to correctly
display the line numbers.

See also [.numberLines](#numberlines) and [startFrom](#startfrom).

#### `operator= "group" | "full" | "detail"`

Determines how operator character sequences will be highlighted.

#### <code>pad=<em>column</em></code> {#pad}

Ensures that `::RESOURCE` data lines and doc-comments
will be padded up to <em>column</em> if they have less than
<em>column</em> characters. This may be useful when using
contrasting backgrounds, because it will ensure that the
whole resource/comment displays as a rectangle.

~~~rexx {pad=80 patch="element EL.RESOURCE_DATA #FF0/#F0F"}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- This code block is using "pad=80" and a high-contrast style patch for      --
-- ::RESOURCE data lines.                                                     --
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
::Resource Text END "The End"
Haya o no haya haya en La Haya,
me dice mi aya que alla en La Haya
el haya se halla.
The End
~~~

#### <code>patch=<em>filename</em></code> {#patch}

File *filename* will contain the style patch file applied to this code block.
*Filename* is relative to the file containing the code block.

#### <code>source=<em>filename</em></code>

Read the code to highlight from *filename* instead of the code block.
*Filename* is relative to the file containing the code block.

#### `special= "group" | "full" | "detail"`

Determines the highlighting of special character sequences.

#### <code>startFrom=<em>nnn</em></code> {#startfrom}

When used with the `.numberLines` option, set the line number
of the first line to *nnn*.

See also [.numberLines](#numberlines) and [numberWidth](#numberwidth).

~~~rexx {.numberLines startFrom=97}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- This small listing will start at line 97
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exit
~~~

See also [.numberLines](#numberlines).

#### <code>style=<em>style</em></code>

Enclose the code with a <code>&lt;div class="highlight-rexx-<em>style</em>"&gt;</code> tag.
Default is "dark". Style names can only use uppercase or lowercase ANSI letters or numbers
(i.e., XRange("ALNUM"), plus ".", "-" or "_".

#### `tutor` {#tutor}

[TUTOR-flavored Unicode support](/rexx-parser/doc/unicode/).

An example: the `FencedCode` program source
----------------------------------------------------------------

The program listing below is produced by inserting the two following lines in the HTML source.

~~~~
~~~rexx {source=../../../bin/FencedCode.cls}
~~~

Here is the program output:

~~~rexx {source=../../../bin/FencedCode.cls}
