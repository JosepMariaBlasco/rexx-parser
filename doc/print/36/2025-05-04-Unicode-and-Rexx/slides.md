What is TUTOR? {.slide}
==============

- TUTOR is an acronym for *T*he *U*nicode *T*ools *O*f *R*exx.
- A collection of software utilities showing how a possible
  implementation of Unicode for Rexx could be.
- In this sense, TUTOR is simply a set of ideas,
  to encourage discussion about Rexx and Unicode,
  and an aid to visualize a possible way in which Rexx and Unicode could match.
- It is a prototype, not tuned for efficiency.
  It is neither a standard, nor a finished product.
- Written in 2024 by Josep Maria Blasco, it incorporates many useful
  suggestions discussed in the Rexx Architecture Review Board.
- Originally *toys*, not *tools*. Changed by popular suggestion,
  although "toys" seems to best describe
  what the software collection has ended up being.
- Originally "toys *for* Rexx", not "toys *of* Rexx".
  Chip Davis suggested the change which produced
  the current, really nice, acronym.

This presentation will be devoted to highlighing the
main features of the TUTOR package.

Unicode and Rexx, Today {.slide}
=======================

With the right editor and an appropiately configured terminal program, one
can *use* Unicode strings today.

~~~rexx
  -- Accented characters and non-latin characters
  Say "Jos√© Mar√≠a Blasco ‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á"

  -- Emojis
  Say "ü¶Üüçêü¶ûüçê"
~~~

These Unicode strings can be stored in files, retrieved, used
as file names,[^filenames] etc.

BUT... Although we can **use** Unicode strings, we cannot properly **manipulate** them.
Assuming a UTF-8 encoding,

~~~rexx
  Say Length("ü¶Üüçêü¶ûüçê")    -- 16, instead of the expected 4
  Say Right("Jos√©",1)         -- "A9"X (unprintable), instead of the expected "√©"
~~~

[^filenames]: With some limitations, depending on many different factors. For example,
Dropbox cannot synchronize files which contain emojis in their filenames.

What is a character? {.slide}
====================

To properly manipulate Unicode strings and still be compatible
with existing programs, TUTOR needs to be able to recognize "old", Classic Rexx, strings,
composed of characters that are **bytes**, and "new", Unicode, strings,
where the notion of "character" becomes much more complex.

~~~rexx
  /* As a UTF-8 character string, "ü¶Üüçêü¶ûüçê" consists of 16 bytes   */
  /* As a Unicode string, "ü¶Üüçêü¶ûüçê" consists of 4 emoji codepoints */
~~~

Indeed, the Unicode standard provides *two* different
definitions of what a Unicode character is:
**codepoints**, which roughly correspond to letters, numbers,
other symbols (including emojis) and diacritics,
and **extended grapheme clusters**, which are defined
to be "user-perceived characters".

For example, the emoji sequence "üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶üéÖ" consists of **two**
extended grapheme clusters, namely "üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶" and "üéÖ";
**eight** codepoints, that is, the emojis for "üë®" (man),
"üë©" (woman), "üëß" (girl) and "üë¶" (boy), "glued" together
with three *Zero-width-joiners*, a special Unicode codepoint used to build
compound characters and emojis, and "üéÖ", the emoji for "Father Christmas";
and, finally, **twenty-nine** bytes, corresponding to the UTF-8 representation
of the string.

String types {.slide}
============

The same string, then, can be viewed (1) as an array of **bytes**,
(2) as an array of **codepoints** and (3)
as an array of **extended grapheme clusters**.
We say that a string "comes with" its own way of being viewed,
which we will call its **type**.

A `BYTES` string is an array of bytes. A `CODEPOINTS` string
is an array of codepoints. A `GRAPHEMES` string is an
array of graphemes. A `TEXT` string is a `GRAPHEMES`
string that has been NFC-normalized at string creation time.

Classic Rexx strings are `BYTES` strings.

`BYTES`, `CODEPOINTS`, `GRAPHEMES` and `TEXT` are also BIF names.
You convert between types by using these BIFs. Left to right
conversions are called **promotions**, and right to left
conversions are called **demotions**. Converting from
`BYTES` to `GRAPHEMES` is a promotion, and converting
from `TEXT` to `CODEPOINTS`is a demotion. Demotion will always work.
Promotion will fail if the argument string is not valid UTF-8.
Converting to `TEXT` may alter the original string, because
of the extra NFC normalization step, and, in this case,
we won't be dealing with *the same* string, but with an
*equivalent* one.

New string suffixes {.slide}
===================

A string wih a `Y` suffix
is a `BYTES` string. `BYTES("string")` and `"string"Y`
have the same value. `BYTES("string")` is
a BIF call (it has a run-time cost), but `"string"Y` is
checked at translation time.

- `"string"Y` is equivalent to `BYTES("string")`.
- `"string"P` is equivalent to `CODEPOINTS("string")`.
- `"string"G` is equivalent to `GRAPHEMES("string")`.
- `"string"T` is equivalent to `TEXT("string")`.

~~~rexx {unicode}
  Say Length("‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á"Y)               -- 18 (bytes)
  Say Length("‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á"P)               -- 6  (codepoints)
  Say Length("‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á"G)               -- 3  (graphemes)
  Say Length("‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á"T)               -- 3  (same as "G")
~~~

The type of a string can be obtained by using the `STRINGTYPE` BIF.

~~~rexx {unicode}
  Say StringType("‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á"Y)           -- BYTES
  Say StringType("ü¶Üüçêü¶ûüçê"G)     -- GRAPHEMES
~~~

Unsuffixed strings: The default string type {.slide}
===========================================

Determining what should be the semantics of a unsuffixed
string in Unicode-enabled Rexx is quite involved.
In Classic Rexx, a unsuffixed string is what we call
a `BYTES` string, but a new user would most probably expect
the default to be `TEXT`, and have immediate access to
all the Unicode features.

~~~rexx
  Options DefaultString Codepoints  -- All strings are CODEPOINTS by default
  Say Length("ü¶Üüçêü¶ûüçê")          -- 4
  Options DefaultString Bytes       -- All strings are BYTES by default
  Say Length("ü¶Üüçêü¶ûüçê")          -- 16
~~~

TUTOR defines the default to be `TEXT`, but it also allows
to configure a different default, by providing an
`OPTIONS DEFAULTSTRING option` instruction. *Option* has to be
one of `BYTES`, `CODEPOINTS`, `GRAPHEMES`, `TEXT` or `NONE`.
When *option* is not `NONE`, every number, variable, or
constant symbol are first checked to see if
they have a stringtype assigned and, if not, they are
automatically converted to the *option* type.
When *option* is `NONE`, no conversion is attempted.

Mixing string types {.slide}
===================

What happens when we mix different string types in the same expression?
For example, when a `TEXT` string and a `BYTES` string
are concatenated, what is the type of the result?

~~~rexx
Options Coercions Promote        -- Convert to the strongest type
Options Coercions Demote         -- Convert to the weakest type
Options Coercions Left           -- Convert to the type of the left operand
Options Coercions Right          -- Convert to the type of the right operand
Options Coercions None           -- Do not allow conversions (produce a syntax error)
~~~

TUTOR is agnostic in this respect. There are only three sensible things
to do when mixing operands of different types in the same expression:

- Forbid the operation and produce a `SYNTAX` error.
- Promote the weakest operand (towards "more Unicode").
- Demote the strongest operand (towards "less Unicode").

For completeness, TUTOR also allows to convert
to the type of the left or the right operand.

U strings {.slide}
=========

In addition to Y, P, G and T strings, TUTOR defines a new, specialized type of
string, the U string. U strings allow the designation of individual code points
by hexadecimal value, by name, by alias or by label:

~~~rexx {unicode}
  Say "(Man)"U                    -- "üë®", an emoji
  Say "(Man)(Woman)"U             -- "üë®üë©", two emojis
  Say "(Man)(ZWJ)(Woman)"U        -- "üë®‚Äçüë©", an emoji grapheme cluster
  Say "61"U                       -- "a"
  Say "0061"U                     -- "a"
  Say "U+0061"U                   -- Also "a". The "U+" prefix is optional
  Say "(Latin Small Letter A)"U   -- "a"
  Say "(LatinSmallLetterA)"U      -- "a": blanks are ignored
  Say "(LATINSMALL LETTERA)"U     -- "a": case is also ignored
~~~

U strings are low-level constructs, as are binary and hexadecimal strings, and
therefore they are always BYTES strings. If you need them in another role,
you will have to promote them first.

New low-level character manipulation functions {.slide}
==============================================

`C2U` and `U2C`, the U versions of `C2X` and `X2C`:

~~~rexx {unicode}
  Say C2U("üçêü¶û")                       -- "1F350 1F99E", two hexadecimal codepoint
  Say C2U("üçêü¶û","Names")               -- "(PEAR) (LOBSTER)"
  Say U2C("(Pear) 1f99e")                -- "üçêü¶û"
~~~

`N2P` and `P2N`, *N*ame to code*P*oint and code*P*oint to *N*ame conversions:

~~~rexx {unicode}
  Say N2P("LATIN CAPITAL LETTER F")     -- "0046" (padded to four digits)
  Say N2P("BELL")                       -- "1F514" (codepoint for "üîî")
  Say P2N("1F342")                      -- "FALLEN LEAF" (The "üçÇ" emoji)
  Say P2N("0012")                       -- "<control-0012>" (a label, not a name)
~~~

A single API for all string types {.slide}
=================================

To manipulate `CODEPOINTS`, `GRAPHEMES` or `TEXT` strings, we will
use the usual set of built-in functions (`LENGTH`, `SUBSTR`, `UPPER`, ...)
and operators (`||`, `+`, ...): they will operate on the
corresponding definition of what a *character* is.

~~~rexx {unicode}
  Call Print "üë®‚Äçüë©"T                      -- "üë®‚Äçüë©" -- 1F468 200D 1F469
  Call Print "üë®‚Äçüë©"P                      -- "üë®" -- 1F468
                                        -- "‚Äç" -- 200D
                                        -- "üë©" -- 1F469
  Say Length("Jose"P || "301"U)         -- 5 codepoints   ["301"U is the acute accent]
  Say Length("Jose"G || "301"U)         -- 4 graphemes
  Say C2X("Jose"G || "301"U)            -- "4A6F7365CC81"X
  Say C2X("Jose"T || "301"U)            -- "4A6F73C3A9"X (normalized to NFC)
Exit

Print: string = Arg(1)
  Do i = 1 To Length(string)
    c = SubStr(string, i, 1)
    Say '"'c'" --' C2U(c)
  End
Return
~~~


Unicode-enabled streams {.slide}
=======================

By default, streams continue to be byte-oriented, but we can
also specify an encoding when opening a stream:

~~~rexx {unicode}
  Call Stream filename, "Command", "Open read ENCODING IBM-1047"
~~~

Rexx will automatically convert to and from Unicode when using encoded
streams. When an ill-formed character is encountered, the default action
is to substitute it by the Unicode Replacement Character, `"ÔøΩ"` (`"FFDD"U`).

~~~rexx {unicode}
  Call Stream filename, "Command", "Open read ENCODING IBM-1047 SYNTAX"
~~~

If you specify `SYNTAX`, a syntax error is produced instead.

You can also specify the target string type as `TEXT` (the default),
`GRAPHEMES`, or `CODEPOINTS`. Remember that `TEXT` strings are
automatically normalized to NFC format.

A procedural-first definition of Unicode for Rexx {.slide}
=================================================

As you will probably have realized, all the TUTOR Rexx
extensions we have described are **purely procedural**,
that is, they can be implemented by extending
a non-object oriented implementation of Rexx, like Regina.

The **current implementation** of TUTOR, though,
uses ooRexx 5.0 and four new basic classes, which correspond
to the four basic string types (`BYTES` becomes a conceptually
synonym for `STRING`, with some small Unicode extensions).
Although these classes show a possible way to extend ooRexx
to accomodate Unicode functionality,
they are a contingency of the actual implementation.

One should be able to implement the procedural
funcionality described by TUTOR in a non-object oriented
version of Rexx. We describe this fact by saying that
our definition of Unicode for Rexx is **procedural-first**.

The Rexx Preprocessor for Unicode (1/2) {.slide}
=======================================

If you want to experiment with TUTOR, you can use
the **Rexx Preprocessor for Unicode**. The Preprocessor,
called RXU (*R*e*X*x and *U*nicode)
is implemented by a Rexx program, `rxu.rex`.

The simplest way to use the preprocessor is the following:
you write a RXU program, that is, a Rexx program with Unicode TUTOR
features, and give it a `.rxu` extension.

~~~rexx {unicode}
/* isnamevalid.rxu */
Signal On Syntax
Parse Arg name
c = U2C( "("name")" )
Say "The name '"name"' is a valid Unicode name."
Say "It corresponds to '"c"' ('"C2U(c)"'U)."
Exit 0

Syntax: Say "'"name"' is not a valid Unicode name."
Exit 1
~~~

The Rexx Preprocessor for Unicode (2/2) {.slide}
=======================================

You can then readily call your program using `rxu`:

~~~ {.dark}
C:\test>rxu isnamevalid guitar
The name 'guitar' is a valid Unicode name.
It corresponds to 'üé∏' ('1F3B8'U).
C:\test>rxu isnamevalid papoola
'papoola' is not a valid Unicode name.
~~~

The preprocessor invokes [the Rexx Parser](https://rexx.epbcn.com/rexx-parser/)
to obtain a parsed version of your program, which is then
translated into a standard ooRexx program, in this case
`isnamevalid.rex`.

The translated program is called with the supplied
arguments, and the return code is stored by `rxu`;
the translated program is then deleted, and the return code
is passed to the caller.

The net effect is that you can write Unicode-extended programs, give
them a `.rxu` extension, and call them with the `rxu` command,
in the same way that you can write a `.rex` program
and call it using the `rexx` command.

The rxutry.rex utility {.slide}
======================

The `rxutry` utility is a version of `rexxtry` modified
to support Unicode.

~~~ {.dark}
C:\test>rxutry
REXX-ooRexx_5.1.0(MT)_64-bit 6.05 21 Nov 2024
üëârxutry.rex lets you interactively try Unicode-REXX statements.
    Each string is executed when you hit Enter.
    Enter 'call tell' for a description of the features.
üëâ  Options DefaultString is Text
üëâ  Options Coercions     is Promote
  Go on - try a few...            Enter 'exit' to end.
Say "Jose" || "301"U
Jos√©
  ............................................ rxutry.rex on WindowsNT
couple = Text("(Man)(Zero Width Joiner)(Woman)"U)
  ............................................ rxutry.rex on WindowsNT
Say couple Length(couple) Length(Bytes(couple))
üë®‚Äçüë© 1 11
  ............................................ rxutry.rex on WindowsNT
exit
C:\test>
~~~

The net-oo-rexx software bundle and ooRexxShell {.slide}
===============================================

Rony Flatscher is curating a nice software bundle, called *net-oo-rexx*,
which puts together a number of packages, including TUTOR and
the Rexx Parser. After installing net-oo-rexx,
you will enjoy immediate access to all the packages,
without having to individually install every one of them separately.

<pre class="dark"><b>D:\Dropbox\net-oo-rexx-packages&gt;oorexxshell

In particular, net-oo-rexx includes a copy of
Jean-Louis Faucher's ooRexxShell, a RexxTry-like environment
with many useful extensions and enhancements, distributed
with his Executor ooRexx variant.
The version of ooRexxShell distributed with net-oo-rexx
automatically loads TUTOR at initialization time, and therefore you
can choose to use ooRexxShell instead of rxutry if you want to play with TUTOR.

Acknowledgements {.slide}
================

Jean-Louis Faucher has integrated TUTOR into
ooRexxShell, and Rony Flatscher has included TUTOR and
the Rexx Parser in the net-oo-rexx distribution.
TUTOR could not have been developed without the extensive
conversations held in the Rexx Architecture Review Board (ARB)
in 2024, in particular in meetings with Ren√© Jansen and Jean-Louis Faucher.

I also want to thank my colleagues at EPBCN, Laura Blanco, Silvina Fern√°ndez,
Mar Mart√≠n, David Palau, Olga Palomino and Amalia Prat,
who have read several drafts of this presentation
and helped to improve it with their comments and suggestions.
